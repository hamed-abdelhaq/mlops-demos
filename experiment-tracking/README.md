## Definition of Experiment Tracking
Experiment tracking (ET) is the process of keeping track of all the relevant information from an ML experiment, which may include:

* Source code
* Environemtn
* Data
* Hyperparameters
* Metrics 
* ...

_Relevant information_ may vary depending on the nature of the experiment: you may be experimenting with different data sources, or perhaps tuning the hyperparameters, or any other kind of experiment with different kinds of results to track.

## Why is Experiment Tracking important?

There are 3 main reasons for tracking experiments:
* ***Reproducibility***: as data scientists, we want our experiments to be repeatable in the future in order to verify our results.
* ***Organization***: if you're collaborating with a team, it's important that everyone knows where to find what. And even if you're working alone, you may want to go back to previous work, and having it organized it helps tremendously.
* ***Optimization***: the usage of experiment tracking tools allows us to create more efficient workflows and automate certain steps which are usually performed manually.
